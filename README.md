# API Platform Boilerplate

## Project

Built with **API platform** using the following technologies: Symfony 4.4.*, Doctrine 2, Lando (Docker) and more technologies.

API Platform is a powerful but easy to use full stack framework dedicated to API-driven projects. It contains a PHP library to create fully featured APIs supporting industry-leading standards (JSON-LD, GraphQL, OpenAPI...), provides ambitious JavaScript tooling to consume those APIs in a snap (admin, PWA and mobile apps generators, hypermedia client...).

### Installing dependencies

- You have to install **Lando**: https://docs.devwithlando.io/

If Lando's tools does not work for you, there is another way. You must install the environment manually: XAMP, Composer, Node.JS, NPM or Yarn and Gulp CLI.

For more information visit:

- XAMP: https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html
- Composer: https://getcomposer.org/
- Node and NPM: https://nodejs.org/es/
- Yarn: https://yarnpkg.com/es-ES/
- Gulp: https://gulpjs.com/

**Note:** If you work with Windows. To execute the commands, we recommend installing **Cygwin** http://www.cygwin.com/

**Note:** I recommend installing the following IDE for PHP Programming: Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) or PHPStorm (recommended) (https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/).
